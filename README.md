## Battle-Puno | Rules v0.1.0

Most rules are same as original uno, and all details will be listed below.


## General rules:
  - **Beginning:**<br>
  At the beginning of the game, each player draws a card from the deck, and the player with the highest card point(see the 'Card Point' below) will play first with clockwise order. 
  
  - **Main process:**<br>
  First draws a coloured card on table(if not put back and draws again then shuffle), the one plays the card must play the card matched to last card's colour(red/blue/green/yellow) or symbol(0-9, skip, reverse......). The black color card can be played regardless of the color of previous card.
  If any player has no cards in the hand, the round ends and calculate the score. And the last card in the hand MUST NOT be black card except 'wild', otherwise draw a card from the deck.
  
  - **Overtime:**<br>
  When it comes there's no card left on deck, the game continues. If the player has no more card to play, he/she keeps the card in hand but no longer be able to play in this round(knocked out). The rest players follow the same process until there's only one player left and he/she also has no card to play.
